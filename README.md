Advent of Code Solutions

Solutions are organized according to the implementation language. The solution for day D is found in `dayD` in every folder, with comments explaining how the solution works. Each folder also contains a file `all` which contains all solutions, without any explanations.

All file paths are assumed to be relative to the root of the repository.
